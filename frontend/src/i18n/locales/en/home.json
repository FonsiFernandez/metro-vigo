    "description": "Vigo Metro is a fictional urban rail network envisioned to connect the city’s key areas (the historic center, the waterfront, major transport hubs, beaches, and the airport) through fast, reliable transfers and frequent service.\n\nBeyond a technical exercise, this project aims to inspire and encourage public institutions to reflect on the transformative value that a system like this could bring to Vigo. A modern metro network would not only improve daily mobility, but also support sustainable growth, reduce unnecessary road traffic, and create a better-connected, more accessible city for residents and visitors alike.\n\nBy strengthening links between neighborhoods, tourism hotspots, and strategic infrastructure, a network of this kind could play a meaningful role in Vigo’s economic development and international appeal, making movement across the city simpler, cleaner, and more efficient.",
